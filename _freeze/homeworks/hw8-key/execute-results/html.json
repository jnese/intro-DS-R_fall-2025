It contains data about courses, students, and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven selected courses (called modules). Presentations of courses start in February and October - they are marked by \"B\" and \"J\" respectively. The dataset (tables) are connected using unique identifiers. All datasets are stored in the .csv format. Please check out the [OULAD](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) site to learn more about the data and understand the keys.\n\n### 1. Start a new RStudio Project\n\n#### 1.1. Be sure to add a folder for \"data\" and \"scripts\".\n\n### 2. Data\n\n#### 2.1. Download the *studentInfo.csv*, *studentAssessment.csv*, and *assessments.csv* data from the course website.\n\n#### 2.2. Place the files in the \"data\" folder in your project.\n\n#### 2.3. Read in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### 3. Join\n\n#### 3.1. Join the *studentassessment* data and the *assessments* data. Specify to join by `id_assessment` and `date`. *Note* that the `date` column has a different name in *studentassessment* (`date_submitted`). Name the joined data *assess_full*. Filter *assess_full* to remove `NA` values in the `code_module` column. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 3.2. Join the *studentinfo* data to the newly created *assess_full* data. Name the joined data *student*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 3.3. What key(s) were used in the join?\n\nid_student, code_module, code_presentation\n\n#### 3.4. How many rows are in the newly created *student* data? If that is different than the number of rows in the *studentInfo* data, why?\n\nThere are 32593 rows in studentInfo and only 29469 rows in student because we removed rows with missing values in the `code_module` variable.\n\n#### 3.5. What new variables were added with this join?\n\ngender, region, highest_education, imd_band, age_band, num_of_prev_attempts, studied_credits, disability, final_result\n\n### 4. Wrangle\n\n#### 4.1. From the *student* data, create a new dataset named *student_tma* that consists only of TMA (Tutor Marked Assessment) assessments.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 4.2. Create a new dataset named *student_tma_max*. First, remove `NA` values in the `score` column. Then keep only the maximum (`max()`) TMA score for each student (**note:** Use `mutate()` and `filter()` so that all columns are retained)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### 4.3. How many rows are in this filtered data? What does each row represent?\n\nEach of the 13309 rows represents a student.\n\n#### 4.4. From *student_tma_max*, reate a dataset named *agg_tma_max* that contains the mean TMA `score` by `highest_education`, `disability`, and `final_result.`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### 5. Plot\n\n#### 5.1. Reproduce the following plot, using any theme and colors you want *except* for the defaults.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw8-key_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
