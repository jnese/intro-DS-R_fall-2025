credit\n-   If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, **please contact the instructor for help rather than submitting incomplete work**\n    -   Contacting the instructor is part of the \"best honest effort\" and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the work is not fully complete\n-   **If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help, it is likely to result is a partial credit score or a zero**\n-   Homeworks are generally due the class after they are assigned, before class starts\n    - 1 week late: 7 points (max)\n    - 2 weeks late: 0 points\n\n## Final Project {.smaller}\n\n-   Group project, 3-4 people\n    + You select or me organize?\n    + The expectations if you select\n-   Quarto document\n\n**Final project must:**\n\n-   Be fully reproducible\n    -   this implies the data are open\n-   Be a collaborative project hosted on GitHub\n-   Move data from its raw \"messy\" format to a tidy data format\n-   Include at least two exploratory plots\n-   Include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models are also encouraged\n\n## Final Project - Dates\n\n-   **Week 3 (10/16)**: Self-selected groups finalized\n-   **Week 5 (10/30)**: Final Project Outline due\n-   **Week 9 (11/28)**: Data prep script due\n-   **Week 10 (12/4)**: Peer review due\n-   **Week 10 (12/4)**: Final project presentations\n-   **Week 11 (12/11)**: Final Paper due\n\n## Final Project - Paper Scoring Rubric\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"hwwpvlshri\"

now!\n\nR 4.1.0 introduced a native pipe operator, `|>`. As described in the R News:\n\n> R now provides a simple native forward pipe syntax `|>`. The simple form of the forward pipe inserts the left-hand side as the first argument in the right-hand side call. \n\nThe behavior of the native pipe is basically the same as the `%>%` pipe  (from the `{magrittr}` package)\n\nLuckily there’s no need to commit entirely to one pipe or the other — you can use the base pipe for the majority of cases where it’s sufficient and use the magrittr pipe when you really need its special features.\n\nMore [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/#-vs).\n\n## Why use `%>%`\n\nChaining arguments is **efficient** and **easy to read**\n\n. . .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  filter(relig == \"Buddhism\",\n         age > 55) %>% \n  select(age, partyid, rincome) %>% \n  arrange(age) %>% \n  slice(1:4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n    age partyid          rincome       \n  <int> <fct>            <fct>         \n1    56 Not str democrat $25000 or more\n2    56 Ind,near dem     $25000 or more\n3    56 Not str democrat $4000 to 4999 \n4    56 Independent      $25000 or more\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n**Equivalent to:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nslice(arrange(select(filter(gss_cat, relig == \"Buddhism\", age > 55), age, partyid, rincome), age), 1:5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Next time\n\n## Before next class {.smaller}\n\n-   Reading\n\n    -   [Week 1 reading](https://jnese.github.io/intro-DS-R_fall-2024/#week-1-introduction) (if you haven't already)\n        + [R4DS(2e) Ch. 5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style)\n        + [R4DS(2e) Ch. 3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics)\n        + [R4DS(2e) Ch. 7](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts)\n\n-   Assignments\n\n    -   [Installs](https://jnese.github.io/intro-DS-R_fall-2024/install.qmd)\n    -   [A Quick Tour of the RStudio IDE](http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-a-quick-tour-of-r-studio)\n    -   [Codecademy: Introduction to R Syntax](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-r/lessons/introduction-to-r/exercises/why-r)\n",
